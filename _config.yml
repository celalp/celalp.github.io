# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I'm a driven data scientist with a Ph.D. fueled by innovative research. My technical skills are rock-solidâ€”I'm proficient in Python, 
  R, and SQL for tackling large datasets, and I have extensive experience building and optimizing machine learning models using 
  TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. I excel at developing predictive algorithms, streamlining data pipelines with tools 
  and transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights. I'm passionate about leading high-impact projects, solving 
  tough problems, and mentoring teams. I enjoy thinking about data and how we see data with its implications well beyond a single domain.
