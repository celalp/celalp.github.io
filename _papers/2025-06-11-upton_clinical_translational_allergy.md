## Abstract

### Background: 

Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is a management strategy for food allergies, typically one
at a time, with maintenance doses ≥300mg protein. However, 30% of allergic children have multiple
trigger foods, and large maintenance doses are associated with side effects. If efficacious, Very
Low-Dose OIT (VLOIT) may enhance safety in multi-OIT.

### Methods: 
Eighteen children with allergies to 2-5 nuts (tree nuts, peanuts) were enrolled
(NCT03799328). Oral food challenge (OFC)-confirmed allergies to their nut mix at </=444mg protein
each nut followed by initiation of an open-label mix of 4mg protein/nut with dose increases every 2
months up to a maintenance dose of 30mg protein/nut. After 18 months, an exit-OFC assessed
allergic threshold changes, with a maximum of 2040mg protein/nut. Efficacy was evaluated using
pre-post treatment and proportional analyses (Wilcoxon signed-ranks, two-tailed Fisher’s test).

### Results: 
The median age at enrollment was 5.0 years (IQR 3.13-9.62). The baseline median
tolerated dose was 10mg protein/nut (IQR 3-100mg). Three withdrew, one did not reach the target
maintenance but was invited for the exit OFC, resulting in 15/18 eligible for exit OFC. The median
tolerated dose at exit OFC was 1000mg (IQR 300-1000mg), with a significant difference from
baseline (p<0.0001). Ten out of 15 participants tolerated the maximum dose (p<0.0001). Intention-
to-treat analysis showed that 14/18 children met pre-defined efficacy measures: tolerated 5X their
baseline dose or ≥300mg (p<0.001). No patients required epinephrine during treatment.

### Conclusions: 
VLOIT led to a significant increase in the tolerated dose to multiple nuts.
