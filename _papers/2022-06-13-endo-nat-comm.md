# Abstract

Exertional heat illness (EHI) and malignant hyperthermia (MH) are life threatening conditions associated with muscle breakdown in the setting of triggering factors including volatile anesthetics, exercise, and high environmental temperature. To identify new genetic variants that predispose to EHI and/or MH, we performed genomic sequencing on a cohort with EHI/MH and/or abnormal caffeine-halothane contracture test. In five individuals, we identified rare, pathogenic heterozygous variants in ASPH, a gene encoding junctin, a regulator of excitation-contraction coupling. We validated the pathogenicity of these variants using orthogonal pre-clinical models, CRISPR-edited C2C12 myotubes and transgenic zebrafish. In total, we demonstrate that ASPH variants represent a new cause of EHI and MH susceptibility.
