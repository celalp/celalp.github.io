## Abstract

Pregnancy is associated with extraordinary plasticity in the maternal brain. Studies in humans and other mammals suggest extensive structural and functional remodeling of the female brain during and after pregnancy. However, we understand remarkably little about the molecular underpinnings of this natural phenomenon. To gain insight into pregnancy-associated hippocampal plasticity, we performed single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and snATAC-seq from the mouse hippocampus before, during, and after pregnancy. We identified cell type-specific transcriptional and epigenetic signatures associated with pregnancy and postpartum adaptation. In addition, we analyzed receptor-ligand interactions and transcription factor (TF) motifs that inform hippocampal cell type identity and provide evidence of pregnancy-associated adaption. In total, these data provide a unique resource of coupled transcriptional and epigenetic data across a dynamic time period in the mouse hippocampus and suggest opportunities for functional interrogation of hormone-mediated plasticity.
